**Note**: This year, students can choose the order of the question at which they will be asked.

# Question 1 (Björn Hartmann)
Edwin L. Hutchins, James D. Hollan & Donald A. Norman (1985) **Direct Manipulation Interfaces**, Human–Computer Interaction, 1:4, 311-338, DOI: 10.1207/s15327051hci0104_2 
- What is Direct Manipulation Interface?
- What makes an interface considered as Direct Manipulation Interface?
- What factors do we consider? → Draw a diagram
- Examples:
  - Given 3D manipulation tasks with mouse vs VR interaction tools, which one is more direct? In which way?
  - Word vs Latex, which one is more direct? In which way?
- Is ChatGPT a direct manipulation interface? Why?

# Question 2 (Björn Hartmann)
1. Munehiko Sato, Ivan Poupyrev, and Chris Harrison. 2012.
**Touché: enhancing touch interaction on humans, screens, liquids, and everyday objects.**
In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '12).
Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 483–492. https://doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2207743
2. Karl Willis, Eric Brockmeyer, Scott Hudson, and Ivan Poupyrev. 2012.
**Printed optics: 3D printing of embedded optical elements for interactive devices.**
In Proceedings of the 25th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology (UIST '12).
Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 589–598. https://doi.org/10.1145/2380116.2380190
3. Saul Greenberg and Bill Buxton. 2008.
**Usability evaluation considered harmful (some of the time).**
In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '08).
Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 111–120. https://doi.org/10.1145/1357054.1357074

- High Levels of Touche + Printed 3D Optics
- What are their evaluation methods (or lack of)?
- Conflict or agreement with Usability Evaluation Considered Harmful?

# Question 3 (Eric Paulos)
Luis von Ahn and Laura Dabbish. 2008.
**Designing games with a purpose.**
Commun. ACM 51, 8 (August 2008), 58–67. https://doi.org/10.1145/1378704.1378719

- High Levels
- 3 Game Designs
- Problems with the proposed methods
- How to solve them?
- Are the methods obsolete to the current practice?

# Question 4 (Eric Paulos)
Vannevar Bush. 1996.
**As we may think.**
interactions 3, 2 (March 1996), 35–46. https://doi.org/10.1145/227181.227186

- High Levels
- Motivation
- Memex → explain
- Difference of accessing information back then vs now.
